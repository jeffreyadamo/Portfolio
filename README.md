Week 8 Homework: Portfolio Update  
[Jeffrey Adamo's WebDev Portfolio](https://jeffreyadamo.github.io/Portfolio/)

## Objective

Update of my web development portfolio with projects and homework assignments completed. A simple portfolio was created in week 2 while HTML and CSS were the only languages introduced. Since then, other concepts have been introduced that can now showcase JavaScript, DOM Manipulation, APIs (third-party and server-side) and group collaboration with Git and GitHub.

* [Porfolio](https://jeffreyadamo.github.io/Portfolio/)
